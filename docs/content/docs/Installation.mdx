# Installation

- **Expo / React Native** (Recommended)
- **Nativewind CSS**

## Automatic Installation

Using the CLI is now the easiest way to start a solUI project. You can initialize your project and add components directly via the CLI:

### Installation

Execute one of the following commands in your terminal:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm install -g solui",
    yarn: "yarn global add solui",
    pnpm: "pnpm add -g solui",
    bun: "bun add -g solui",
  }}
/>

### Initialization and Starting the App

Initialize the project by using the `init` command.

```bash
heroui init my-heroui-app
```

Install the dependencies to start the local server:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "cd solui-app && npm install",
    yarn: "cd solui-app && yarn install",
    pnpm: "cd solui-app && pnpm install",
    bun: "cd solui-app && bun install",
  }}
/>

Start the local server:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm run dev",
    yarn: "yarn run dev",
    pnpm: "pnpm run dev",
    bun: "bun run dev",
  }}
/>

### Adding the Components

Once your solUI project is ready to develop, you can add individual components using the CLI. For example, to add a button component:

```bash
solui add button
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the CLI, you may try individual installation to set up solUI in your project:

Most components rely on `nativewind` for CSS and `react-native-vector-icons` for a Icons Library. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install nativewind react-native-vector-icons
```

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm install nativewind react-native-vector-icons n",
    yarn: "yarn add nativewind react-native-vector-icons ",
    pnpm: "pnpm add nativewind react-native-vector-icons ",
    bun: "bun add nativewind react-native-vector-icons ",
  }}
/>

1. Browse the [Components](/docs/components/badge).
2. Click on the component you want to use.
3. Copy the source code or install via solui CLI.
